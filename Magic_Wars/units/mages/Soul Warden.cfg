    description= _ "Legendary wielders of death magic, the power of a Soul Warden rivals that of an Ancient Lich. Their morals are as weak as their magic is strong - utilizing the bodies and souls of their own fallen troops as weapons, the armies they accompany often begin to show their true power when losses are incurred."
